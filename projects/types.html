            <article>
                <h2>CO2 Lasers</h2>
                <p>CO2 lasers are versatile and can engrave a wide range of materials including wood, glass, and certain plastics. They are popular for both hobbyists and professionals due to their ability to produce high-quality engravings on a variety of surfaces. These lasers typically operate at a wavelength of 10.6 micrometers, which makes them well-suited for cutting and engraving organic materials.</p>

                <h2>Fiber Lasers</h2>
                <p>Fiber lasers are ideal for metal engraving and are known for their high precision and efficiency. They operate at a wavelength of around 1.064 micrometers, which allows them to focus on a smaller spot size, providing detailed and accurate engravings. Fiber lasers are often used in industrial applications due to their speed, reliability, and low maintenance requirements. They are excellent for engraving barcodes, serial numbers, and intricate designs on metals.</p>

                <h2>Diode Lasers</h2>
                <p>Diode lasers are suitable for beginners due to their lower cost and ease of use. They can engrave on softer materials like wood and leather. Diode lasers usually emit light at wavelengths ranging from 375 to 1060 nanometers. These lasers are compact, energy-efficient, and are often used in smaller, desktop engraving machines. While they might not be as powerful as CO2 or fiber lasers, they are perfect for hobby projects and small-scale engraving tasks.</p>
